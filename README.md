Also for extended stays the application provides information on any changes be they small or drastic.

## User Story:

With their first search they recieve the weather matching their search input along with a color-coded UV index and a five day forecast organized by date:

After subsequent searches, the user's history is stored. Upon reloading the application, their search history is displayed beneath the search bar, and the page is populated with the data from their most recent search:

The user is also supplied with an option to clear their history which renders the blank slate mode once again. This also clears local storage for further use.

## Use:
